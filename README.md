## About me

I'm currently a 1st year master student at [School of Software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I graduated at [School of Computer Science, Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/). I've been studying Chemistry and Computer Science for the first two years of my undergraduate life. After that, I changed my major from Chemistry to CS. I used to do some [Brain-Computer Interface research](https://bci-vr.yunzinan.top/). Currently, I am mainly doing real-world AI applications.

I love to play tennis🎾 in my spare time. I used to play table tennis when I was in high school.
