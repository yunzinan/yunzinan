## About me

I'm currently a 3rd year student of Computer Science at [Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn). I've been studying Chemistry and Computer Science for the past two years, after which I changed my major from Chemistry to CS. My research interests include but are not limited to BCI(brain-computer interface), Computational Neuroscience, and Machine Learning. I'm eager to find out how our brain works and establish the connection and interaction between the human brain and the computer.
